It hit a high of Rs 1285.35 and low of Rs 1242.15 during the session. \\n\\n On the technical charts, the 200-DMA of the stock stood at Rs 1180.29, while the 50-DMA was at Rs 1239.5. If a stock trades above 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it usually means the immediate trend is upward. On the other hand, if the stock trades below 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it is considered a bearish trend and if trades between these averages, then it suggests the stock can go either way. \\n\\n The stock traded below the signal line of momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalling a bearish bias on the counter. The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect \\\"buy\\\" or \\\"sell\\\" opportunities. \\n\\n On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the stock stands at 46.22. Traditionally, a stock is considered overbought when the RSI value is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30. \\n\\n The return on equity (RoE) for the stock stood at 10.51 per cent while the Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) was at 9.56.

The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low.
