This project follows 3 approaches:
1) Logistic regression and XGBoost with TF-IDF Feature Extraction
2) BiLSTM with GloVe Word Embeddings
3) Transformer Architectures: BERT and RoBERTa

**Logistic Regression and XGBoost with TF- IDF Feature Extraction**

I used logistic regression and XGBoost as my base models. To transform textual data into numerical features, I applied TF-IDF. Then, I trained logistic regression and XGBoost on these TF-IDF features.TF-IDF is an established technique that captures the importance of terms in relation to their frequency within documents and entire dataset.
